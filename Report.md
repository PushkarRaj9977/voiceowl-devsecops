# VoiceOwl DevSecOps Assessment - Report

##  Identified Risks
1. Unscanned container images - Could introduce vulnerabilities.
2. Running containers as root - Privilege escalation risk.
3. Unrestricted pod-to-pod communication - Increases attack surface.
4. Secrets in code - Risk of credential leakage.
5. Lack of observability - No visibility into metrics/logs.

---

## Implemented Solutions
- Docker & Image Hardening:
  - Multi-stage Dockerfile with distroless base image.
  - Non-root user enforced (`runAsUser: 1001`).
  - Trivy scan integrated in pipeline.

- CI/CD Security:
  - GitHub Actions workflow runs:
    - Semgrep for static code analysis.
    - Trivy for image vulnerability scanning.
    - Fail pipeline on HIGH/CRITICAL issues.
  - Push to ECR only after passing security gates.

- Secrets Management:
  - MongoDB credentials stored in Kubernetes `Secret`.
  - No hardcoded secrets in code or manifests.

- Infrastructure as Code:
  - Terraform module provisions VPC + EKS + managed nodes.
  - IaC security scans recommended (`tfsec`, `checkov`).

- Kubernetes Hardening:
  - Resource limits on all pods.
  - NetworkPolicy restricts app â†’ mongo only.
  - Privilege escalation disabled.

- Monitoring & Logging:
  - Datadog Agent DaemonSet deployed for metrics, logs, and APM.
  - High CPU usage alert configured (JSON).

## Suggestions for Production Hardening
1. Secrets Management:
   - Move all app credentials to AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.
   - Use KMS encryption for Kubernetes secrets.

2. Advanced Kubernetes Security:
   - Enforce Pod Security Standards with OPA/Gatekeeper.
   - Add runtime security with Falco/Seccomp profiles.

3. Compliance & Audit Logging:
   - Enable Kubernetes API audit logs.
   - Ensure alignment with SOC2 / GDPR for logging & data retention.

4. Deployment Strategy:
   - Implement Blue/Green or Canary rollouts with Argo Rollouts.
   - Autoscaling enabled for workload right-sizing.

5. Cost Optimization:
   - Use spot instances for non-critical workloads.
   - Apply right-size recommendations for nodes & pods.

##  Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates a secure end-to-end DevSecOps workflow for deploying a Node.js + MongoDB microservice on AWS EKS.  
While core security measures (non-root, scanning, secrets, network policies) are in place, production environments should include runtime security, advanced secrets management, and compliance logging for full coverage.
